                          <p>Making password reset systems for the betterment of humanity. And also cute fluffy organisms, because they are cute and fluffy and fun to snuggle. Unless they're cute and fluffy and bitey, which would be negative. How much of this description is the site going to show? Consider it stress testing, really. After all, some people like to write a lot and some people only write a little -- we have to assume that this system was more designed for the likes of those who only like to write a little about what they're doing and how it will affect them / the company / the city / state / country / continent / planet / solar system / galaxy / universe. I think the only thing bigger than the concept of the universe is the concept of a multiverse, where an untold number of universes exist simultaneously and technically within the same space, but not the same time -- it's weird. In fact, here's the first few paragraphs from wikipedia about the concept of multiverses:</p>
<p>The multiverse (or metaverse[1]) is a hypothetical group of multiple universes including the universe in which humans live. Together, these universes comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, the physical laws and the constants that describe them.[2][3][4][5] The different universes within the multiverse are called the "parallel universes", "other universes", or "alternative universes".[6][7][8]</p>
<p>Doesn't that sound interesting? I'm really starting to think that this field should have a length limit. Maybe eventually I should talk about the actual project? But really we'll get to that during the presentation, so I suppose that it's not tremendously necessary. What is tremendously necessary is that I finish writing this before 3, and it's only 2:09! I've got 51 minutes to continue typing, typing, typing away... I hope I eventually hit a character limit because otherwise I'm going to be here for a very long time.</p>
<p>So here I am, typing away, adding more and more to this description. To whoever's reading this, I hope your project went well -- it always seems like the time limits we have are both too much time and too constricting at the same time, doesn't it? But that's okay; at least there's enough time to get everything done in most cases.</p>
<p>This is taking a bit longer than anticipated and I <em>do</em>&nbsp;have to go work on the presentation at some point. I suppose I'll go do that now. Hopefully the description of our project doesn't take up too much space and hopefully we have an actual character limit, because otherwise it's going to be ridiculous. <em>Ridiculous, I say.</em></p>
